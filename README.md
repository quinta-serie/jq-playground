# JQ Playground (PyQt6)

## Description

A simple desktop application built with **Python** and **PyQt6**, designed as a playground for testing [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) commands on JSON input.
The interface consists of three main sections:

- **Left:** Editable JSON input area.
- **Right:** Editable `jq` command input area.
- **Bottom:** Output area showing the result of execution.

Perfect for quickly experimenting with `jq` queries locally.
